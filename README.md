# Data-Processing-and-Storage
In memory database with transaction support
# Introduction
This C++ program implements an in-memory key-value database with transaction support. It allows users to begin transactions, put key-value pairs, get values for keys, commit transactions, and rollback transactions.

# How to Run
To run the program, follow these steps:

Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
g++ -o in_memory_database in_memory_database.cpp

Execute the compiled program.
./in_memory_database

# Program Modification for Future Official Program
To make this program an official program in the future, the following modifications can be considered:

Clarify the instructions: Provide more detailed explanations of each function and its purpose within the code comments.
Add error handling: Implement more robust error handling to handle edge cases and invalid inputs effectively.
Improve usability: Consider adding a user interface or command-line interface to interact with the database more intuitively.
Provide test cases: Include a set of test cases to ensure the correctness and functionality of the implemented database.
Grading guidelines: Define clear grading criteria, including points for functionality, code quality, documentation, and adherence to best practices.
